# FizzBuzzV2

The goal of FizzBuzz is to build a program that can take a number and if the number is evenly divisible by 3, it should return "Fizz", if it's divisible by 5, it should return "Buzz", and if it's divisible by both 3 and 5, it should return "FizzBuzz".

We expect fizzbuzz(3) to return "Fizz"
We expect fizzbuzz(5) to return "Buzz"
We expect fizzbuzz(15) to return "FizzBuzz"
